"""Fail if docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md contradicts itself, or contradicts the code.

The plan states its own phase, step, substep and rule counts in summary tables.
Those numbers were wrong the first time they were written by hand, and a plan
that miscounts itself is one nobody checks against. Every edit re-derives them
from the document body instead.

That was the whole of this script for two phases, and it was not enough. It
compared the plan against the plan: a closed loop that agreed with itself no
matter what the repository contained. It passed on every commit of Phase 2
while the progress table said Phase 2 had not started, because nothing here
had any way to know that fifteen ``DJA`` rules were registered and running. The
same blind spot let the total count ``DJS-028``, which exists only as a sentence
in Phase 4, alongside forty-five rules that exist as code.

So the checks now come in two kinds, and the second kind is the one that
matters.

*Internal* -- the document against itself:

* per-phase step and substep counts against the progress table
* the totals row
* per-family rule counts against the stated breakdown
* rule ids contiguous from 001 within each family, so a renumbering that drops
  or duplicates one is caught rather than silently shipped

*External* -- the document against ``djaudit.registry``:

* every registered rule is described somewhere in the plan
* the stated implemented count matches the number of registered rules
* a phase called *Not started* has no registered rules and no substep marked
  Done -- the exact error this script used to sail past
* a phase called *Complete* has every rule it introduces registered

A rule is attributed to the phase whose text first mentions it, which is where
that rule is specified. Later mentions are cross-references and are ignored, so
the progress table listing a phase's rules does not re-attribute them to
itself.
