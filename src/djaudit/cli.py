"""Command line interface.

Exit codes are chosen for CI:

* ``0`` -- nothing at or above ``--fail-on``
* ``1`` -- findings at or above ``--fail-on``
* ``2`` -- the tool could not run (bad path, unreadable baseline, bad options),
  or ran but could not analyse enough of the project to be trusted

Keeping "found problems" and "tool broke" on different codes means a pipeline
can tell a real failure from a broken installation. Incomplete analysis belongs
with the latter: a green build from a run that never located the settings is a
worse outcome than a red one.
