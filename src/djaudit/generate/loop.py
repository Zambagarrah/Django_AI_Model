"""Generate, audit, repair, audit again -- and know when to stop.

The loop is four lines of pseudocode and most of this module is the stopping
conditions, because the loop without them is worse than no loop.

**Nothing is written to the real destination until it is accepted.** Every
iteration materialises into a disposable copy of the project, made by the same
``scratch_copy`` the fix verifier has used since Phase 6. A run that fails
leaves the caller's project byte-identical, which is the difference between a
tool you can point at real work and one you run in a scratch directory.

**Auditing inside a copy of the real project is the point.** A generated app
audited in isolation cannot be audited at all: half the rules need the settings
module, the installed apps and the model graph to say anything. So the app is
written into a copy of the project it is destined for and the whole thing is
analysed, which means the findings are the findings that project will actually
have.

**Three stopping conditions, and only one of them is a counter.**

A counter alone stops a runaway loop and tells you nothing. The other two are
the ones that carry information:

*Convergence.* If an iteration clears nothing -- the same fingerprints come
back -- the model is not making progress and another call will not change that.
Stopping on the second identical finding set is cheaper than the ceiling and
gives a better message.

*Regression.* If an iteration declares less than the one before it, the model
removed a feature to silence a finding. That is the degenerate optimum of any
audit-until-clean loop and it must be a hard failure, not a warning: an empty
file passes every rule djaudit has.

**Suppressions are rejected outright.** A model that writes
``# djaudit: ignore`` has found the second degenerate optimum. The prompt says
not to, and this checks, because a prompt is a request.

**What "clean" means.** No findings at or above the caller's threshold, from 87
deterministic rules, in a copy of the real project. It does not mean the app
works, and nothing here runs it: the loop never imports the generated code or
the target's settings, because the static tier's whole claim is that it does
not. Deciding the app is correct is still the caller's job.
