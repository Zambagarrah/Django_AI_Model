"""A provider that actually calls something.

Everything else in this package was written against ``NullProvider``, which
declines. This is the one module that opens a socket, and it is written so that
turning it on changes what djaudit *says* and never what djaudit *decides*: the
findings are still produced by 87 deterministic rules, and a model's reply is
still validated field by field against a schema the caller declared before
asking.

**Two vendors, one shape.** OpenAI-compatible services take a JSON Schema in
``response_format``; Anthropic takes the same schema as a tool's ``input_schema``
and is told to use that tool. Both are handed exactly what
``ResponseSchema.as_json_schema()`` renders, so adding a vendor means writing
an adapter here and nothing above this layer learns a vendor name. Anything
that speaks the OpenAI shape -- vLLM, Ollama, Together, Groq, OpenRouter, Azure
-- works by pointing ``base_url`` at it.

**Failure is a return value.** Every path out of this module that does not
produce a validated answer produces ``Declined``. Not an exception: djaudit's
whole claim is that it is useful without a model, and the way that claim rots
is a network error propagating out of the LLM layer and killing a run that had
already computed its findings. A timeout mid-audit should cost commentary, not
the audit.

**The key cannot reach an error message.** It is read from the environment at
the moment of use, put into a header, and never stored on the instance or
interpolated into any string this module builds. ``_scrub`` is the backstop for
the case that matters more: a vendor that echoes the key back in an error body,
which is not hypothetical. A tool that reports ``DJS-002`` for hardcoded
secrets and then prints one into a CI log would deserve everything it got.

**No new dependencies.** ``urllib.request`` is not a pleasant HTTP client, but
this is one POST with retries, and the alternative is putting httpx into a
package whose runtime dependency list is typer and rich.
